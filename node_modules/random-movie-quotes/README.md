# random movie quotes

A tiny node module that has random movie quotes (generally geek related) that can be used for any number of things. (Think Lorem Ipsum type stuff)

Only has a single function `getQuote`.

## Example

```javascript
var quotes = require('random-movie-quotes')

console.log(quotes.getQuote())
```
